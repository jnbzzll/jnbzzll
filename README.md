# Hi! I'm Jane, a Purdue University CS freshman from Chicago.

I'm most experienced in Java, C++, and Python.
I'm currently learning full-stack web development through the Odin Project.
I also love to do projects with Arduinos and other microcontrollers.
-   I'll upload some of my projects eventually lol.
